## Define the translations

Once you've imported the `TranslateModule`, you can put your translations
in a JSON file that will be imported with the `TranslateHttpLoader`.
The following translations should be stored in `./assets/i18n/en.json`.

```json title="./assets/i18n/en.json"
{
    "app.hello": "hello {{value}}"
}
```

You can also define your translations manually with [`setTranslation()`](/reference/translate-service-api#settranslation).

```ts
translate.setTranslation('en', {
    "app.hello": 'hello {{value}}'
});
```

You can also use nested JSON objects &mdash; this allows you to create more structured translation files and
provide some more context for the translators.

```json
{
    "app": {
        "hello": "hello {{value}}"
    }
}
```

You can then access the value by using the dot notation, in this case `app.hello`.

We highly recommend using [BabelEdit](https://www.codeandweb.com/babeledit) to manage your translations. It allows you to
edit all JSON files at once, keeping them consistent. Features like PreTranslate allow you a
fast preview of your application in other languages.
