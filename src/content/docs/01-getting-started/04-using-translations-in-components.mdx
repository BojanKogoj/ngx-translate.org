You can either use the `TranslateService`, the `TranslatePipe` or the `TranslateDirective` to get your translation values.

## Using the TranslateService in your code

With the **service**, it looks like this:

```ts
translate.get('app.hello', {value: 'world'}).subscribe((res: string) => {
    console.log(res);
    //=> 'hello world'
});
```

You might ask yourself, why [`get()`](/reference/translate-service-api#get) is using a subscription to receive the translation.
This is because your language file might not be loaded when the [get()](/reference/translate-service-api#get) function is called.
The update is triggered when the loading is complete.

You can also use [`stream()`](/reference/translate-service-api#stream) which is similar to `get()` but also fires when the language is changed.

There is also [`instant()`](/reference/translate-service-api#instant) &mdash; a synchronous method that returns the translation value
immediately. This only works if the translation file is already loaded &mdash; or the translations
are set using  [`setTranslation()`]/reference/translate-service-api#settranslation).

## Using translations in templates (TranslatePipe, TranslateDirective)

This is how you do it with the **pipe**:

```html
<div>{{ 'app.hello' | translate:param }}</div>
```

And in your component define `param` like this:
```ts
param = {value: 'world'};
```

You can construct the translation keys dynamically by using simple string concatenation inside the template:

```html
<ul *ngFor="let language of languages">
  <li>{{ 'languages.' + language | translate }}</li>
</ul>
```

Where `languages` is an array member of your component:

```ts
languages = ['en', 'fr', 'de'];
```

You language file would look like this;
```json
{
    'languages': {
        'en': 'English',
        'fr': 'French',
        'de': 'German'
    }
}
```

You can also use the output of the built-in pipes `uppercase` and `lowercase` in order to guarantee
that your dynamically generated translation keys are either all uppercase or all lowercase. For example:

```html
<p>{{ 'roles.' + role | lowercase | translate }}</p>
```

```ts
role = 'ADMIN';
```

will match the following translation:
```json
{
  "roles": {
    "admin": "Administrator"
  }
}
```

<Aside type="tip">

A plugin called **ngx-translate-extract** can help you keeping your source code and translation files in
sync: It extracts the translation IDs from your source code. This does of course not work with
dynamically created IDs like the one above.

</Aside>

This is how you use the **directive**:

```html
<div [translate]="'app.hello'" [translateParams]="{value: 'world'}"></div>
```

Or even simpler using the content of your element as a key:
```html
<div translate [translateParams]="{value: 'world'}">HELLO</div>
```

I recommend not use the **pipe** instead of the directive because both variants of the directive have issues.
The one without a value causes warnings in some IDEs, the first one does currently not properly work
with the message compiler plugin.

## Using HTML tags in your translations

You can easily use raw HTML tags within your translations.

```json
{
    "app.hello": "Welcome to my Angular application!<br><strong>This is an amazing app which uses the latest technologies!</strong>"
}
```

To render them, simply use the `innerHTML` attribute with the pipe on any element.

```html
<div [innerHTML]="'app.hello' | translate"></div>
```

`[innerHTML]` should be safe to use because it uses Angular's `DomSanitizer` to filter potentially harmful tags like
`<script>` or `<style>`.
